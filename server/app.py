"""
FastAPI application for the Judicial Reasoning RL Environment.
Team ALACRITY — OpenEnv Hackathon

This module creates an HTTP server that exposes the JudicialEnv
over HTTP endpoints, compatible with the OpenEnv spec.

The server:
- Exposes /reset, /step, /state endpoints for the RL API
- Hosts the inference runner as a background task on startup
- Stays alive persistently on port 7860 for HF Spaces

APPLICABLE STATUTES: {chr(10).join(obs.statutes)}

COUNCIL DELIBERATION:{deliberation}

STRICT LEGAL RULES — READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANSWERING:
1. Indian Contract Act 1872, Section 73: This section applies to ALL breach of contract claims. You do NOT need a pre-specified monetary penalty in the contract to apply Section 73. The court has the power to assess and award compensation for actual loss suffered (lost salary, lost income, mental distress). NEVER say Section 73 does not apply because no monetary amount is mentioned — that is a fundamental legal error.
2. For EMPLOYMENT / WORKPLACE cases: The PRIMARY statutes are the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (wrongful termination, retrenchment compensation under Section 25F) and the POSH Act 2013 (if the demands were of a sexual or personal nature). Cite these BEFORE the Indian Contract Act.
3. Section 89 CPC encourages mediation — it does NOT mandate it for standard employment disputes.
4. Limitation Act 1963: 3 years for breach of contract claims from the date of the breach.
5. POSH Act 2013: If 'personal demands' could be sexual in nature, the employee should be directed to the Internal Committee (IC) of the company, OR the Local Complaints Committee if no IC exists. This is a faster route than civil courts and can result in reinstatement.
6. Industrial Disputes Act 1947: If the complainant qualifies as a 'workman', termination without 1 month notice or retrenchment compensation (Section 25F) is illegal regardless of the reason given.
7. The 'ratio_decidendi' field is used here as the key legal principle governing this case. Add a note: '(Note: This is an AI summary, not a binding judicial precedent.)'
{extra}

Your task:
1. Weigh the arguments from all three agents and select the most legally sound position.
2. Deliver the FINAL authoritative verdict with comprehensive, fact-specific reasoning.
3. For employment cases: explicitly state whether the POSH Act 2013 and/or Industrial Disputes Act 1947 applies, and direct the complainant to the appropriate forum (Internal Committee / Labour Court / Civil Court).
4. Correctly apply Section 73 — do not refuse to apply it just because no monetary amount is pre-specified.
5. Write a clear legal principle based on these specific facts.
